            <small class="small-left">This project was my first try at making a browser game using HTML Canvas, and Javascript. I decided to make a game that functions similarly to a dungeon crawler in its control scheme, and brought over one of my favorite characters from League of Legends.
                In this game, you play as Twisted Fate and you are able to move using an 8 directional movement system, and are also able to shoot card projectiles that deal damage on hit to monsters.
                In order to win, you must kill all of the green monsters before you are able to kill the red monster, upon killing the red monster you have won.

            <small class="small-right">This was my second project that I created using Javascript, but this time I used LiquidJS to handle all of my views. This is a simple app that uses MongoDB and ExpressJS in the backend to store items, and allow for RESTful routing. During the creation of this Stat Tracker app, I learned a lot about how view templating engines like Liquid work, and also learned heaps about NoSQL Databases. This was the first time I created an app featuring RESTful routes, and the ability to create, read, update, edit, and delete data entries in my database.</small>

            <small class="small-left">This is the fourth project that I created. This project was made using the MERN stack. This project was really useful to me in the way that it helped to solidify my ReactJS skills, as well as hone my skills with MongoDB, and ExpressJS. In this app, I began to focus on styling and how I wanted to make my apps visually appear, and I am pretty satisfied with the amount of styling tricks I learned during this project, and I feel like during this project is when I really started taking a liking to React.</small>
